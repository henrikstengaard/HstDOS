                     What's an Epic distribution site?
                     ---------------------------------

An Epic distribution site is a BBS that:

   * Features a special "Epic MegaGames" file section.
   * Carries all shareware in the Epic product line, which is available for 
     download 24 hours a day.
   * Posts new Epic releases for download as soon as they're available.
   
             ---------------------------------------------------
             Why should my BBS become an Epic distribution site?
             ---------------------------------------------------

As an Epic distribution site,  you'll be able to attract new callers who
are looking for the latest and greatest shareware games.  You will also be 
included on our sysop mailing list and receive occasional updates from us.
