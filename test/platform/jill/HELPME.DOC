Jill of the Jungle is a Nintendo-style arcade adventure game with 256-color
VGA graphics,  great sound effects,  and a Sound Blaster-compatible musical
sound track.  This immense game world,  Volume I in the Jill series,
challenges both your mind and your arcade reflexes -- fun for the whole
family!

We are Epic MegaGames and we're here to bring you the best in animated games
for your PC.  Our 20-person team is busy at work to make new products to
challenge and entertain you.


   HOW TO START:
   =============

To play Jill,
  1. Change to the drive which the game installed to (C:)
  2. Change to the directory which the game installed to (CD \JILL)
  3. Type JILL


   NOTE TO SOUND BLASTER OWNERS:
   =============================

Jill sports a musical sound track and digitized sound effects.  If you
experience trouble with Jill (lockups or aborts), try booting from a blank
floppy disk with no TSR's loaded.  If this doesn't solve the problem, your
best bet is to <gasp> TURN OFF THE DIGITAL SOUND EFFECTS and MUSIC.

Sorry, Jill doesn't support the Adlib card.  Only Sound Blaster & compatibles.

Because Jill was programmed before 16-bit sound technology, it may not support    
all 16 bit sound cards.  If you own a Sound Blaster 16, Jill's sound effects
may be slow and distorted.  The only soution to this problem is to turn off
all digital sound effects.


   NOTE TO OS/2 USERS
   ==================

On some computers,  Jill only runs under OS/2 with ALL SOUND DISABLED.  So if
Jill isn't working properly under OS/2, run the game by typing:
   JILL /NOSND


   TROUBLE-SHOOTING
   ================

There is a known conflict with Jill and disk compression utilities (such as
Doublespace, Stacker, etc).  If you must use disk compression, install Jill
on an uncompressed partition or drive.

If Jill locks up when you first run the game, type:
   JILL /NOSB  (if you don't have a Sound Blaster)
   JILL /SB    (if you do have a Sound Blaster)
   JILL /NOSND (as a last resort, disables all sound)

If Jill is giving you intermittent problems, boot from a blank floppy disk
with no TSR's in memory.  You might possibly run into problems with:
   - Memory managers like QEMM
   - Disk Caches
   - Any other kind of TSR program

Any ERROR CODE means you have insufficent conventional memory.  Try booting 
from a blank floppy.

Make sure your FILES= and BUFFERS= lines in CONFIG.SYS are set to at least 25.


   HINT

This game is equiped with a "Save" feature -- so remember to save your game
often.  Later on,  if your bratty little brother unplugs the computer
while you are playing,  you won't need to start over!
