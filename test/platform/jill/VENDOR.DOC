JILL OF THE JUNGLE VERSION 1.2 from Epic MegaGames (Member ASP)

     Jill of the Jungle is the hottest shareware game release ever!  Epic
MegaGames brings you a new era in computer entertainment with this 256-color
VGA arcade-adventure game which is up to par with the top Sega Genesis and
Super Nintendo hits.  Features digital sound effects and a musical soundtrack
for the Sound Blaster and compatible cards!

     Guide the beautiful Jill through sixteen huge smooth-scrolling levels,
each filled with vivid new scenery and animated creatures.  Not only can Jill
run, jump, and use objects -- she can also magically transform into other
creatures such as birds, fish, and frogs.  In fact,  you will do quite a
bit of hopping, flying, and swimming to solve this game.

     Jill also supports CGA and EGA cards,  but the real thrill of this game
is the spectacular 256-color VGA artwork and animation.  In fact,  we believe
games like Duke Nukum could learn a few tricks from the smoothly-animated
Jill.


Requirements:
     þ  CGA, EGA, or VGA graphics (supports high-quality 256-color graphics.)
     þ  80286 or faster processor recommended
     þ  512K memory and DOS 3.0 or later

Also supports:
     þ  Sound Blaster & compatible music cards
     þ  Joystick

Credits:  Tim Sweeney, programming and design; John Pallett-Plowright and
Joe Hitchens, artwork; Dan Froelich, musical sound track.  With thanks to
Larry Tipton and Adam Rixey.
